## About
**Date of completion: 27/11/2022**
 
The Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge tests ones abilility to develop a server that can host an application with various routes, set up to receive requests. Additionally, the game-logic should be test-driven using `Mocha`, and should allow the user to play against the computer. Ultimately, this project was designed to test back-end fundamentals. 

### Methodology
1) Refractored an example project (battle challenge).
2) Wrote unit-tests for routing and game-logic.

## Getting Started

  
### Installation:
- Install npm: ```npm install```
- npm install [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)
- npm install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- npm install [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- npm install test dependencies: ```npm i --save chai mocha chai-http```


### Starting The Server:

```
npm test
```



## Problem Statements
